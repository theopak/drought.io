# Drought.io ![build status]https://travis-ci.org/theopak/drought.io.svg)

by Theo Pak & Altan Gulen for Prof. Cutler's CSCI-4960 "Interactive Visualization" class at RPI.

The interactive visualization is designed for general populations in areas indirectly affected by droughts. Surprise! It turns out that everyone is indirectly affected when prolonged droughts affect critical industries like agriculture. Meteorologists, geoscientists, and visualization geeks may also appreciate the demonstration of an approach for visualizing this information in a way that general audiences understand better than current drought visualizations.

What parts of the world are facing droughts, and exactly how big are those areas? How does historical rainfall data indicate a drought, and how can drought forecasts be explained using rainfall forecasts? This visualization should be a graphical layer over other GIS data such as arable lands.

We hypothesize that because: (a) a significant decrease in rainfall year over year will result in a drought for the corresponding geographic area; and (b) rainfall can be predicted and visualized in a way that general audiences find easy to understand; then (c) the emergence, continuation, and end of droughts can be predicted and visualized in a way that general audiences find easy to understand.

We will know if the visualization effectively communicates the way that droughts affect people if the user learns something about areas that are currently experiencing a drought (or are at risk to experience a drought in the near future) and about the reasons that such areas affect the user personally.
